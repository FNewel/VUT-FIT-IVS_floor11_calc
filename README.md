## About The Project
### IVS - Project 2 - F11 Calculator
![F11 Calculator](screenshot.png?raw=true "F11 Calculator")

Basic mathematical calculator with GUI, mathematical operations, factorials, roots, documentation, manual and math library.

### About
The main point of this project was to learn how to work in a team, use git and to try and create a new software product from scratch. 
This involves: creating a plan of the project, programming individual units that will make up our project, testing them, integrating them and creating one, fully operational software product which should fill the needs of our customer.
